# ingest.py
#
# PURPOSE:
#   This is stage 1 of the query-expansion RAG pipeline.
#   It reads the raw quarterly PDF reports, cuts them into small
#   overlapping text chunks, converts every chunk into a numeric
#   vector (an embedding), and saves the whole thing to disk as a
#   FAISS index.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS — THE BOUNDARY PRINCIPLE:
#   Think of this file as the loading dock.
#   Raw PDFs come in. A searchable vector index goes out.
#   Everything downstream — retriever.py, query_expansion.py — never
#   touches a PDF directly. They only ever talk to the FAISS index
#   this file produces. If we ever swap PyPDFLoader for a different
#   PDF parser, or change how we chunk, this is the only file that
#   needs to change.
#
# WHY WE CHUNK BEFORE EMBEDDING:
#   Embedding models have a token limit, and a whole 3-page PDF report
#   won't fit inside one embedding meaningfully anyway — a single vector
#   for an entire document would blur together the revenue numbers, the
#   CEO commentary, and the balance sheet into one vague point in space.
#   Small chunks let each vector represent one specific idea, so a
#   search for "Q2 EBITDA" can match the exact paragraph that mentions it.
#
# SHOULD YOU RUN THIS FILE DIRECTLY?
#   Yes — this is the entry point for stage 1. Run it once whenever
#   you add, remove, or change the source PDFs. It must be run before
#   retriever.py or query_expansion.py, since both depend on the FAISS
#   index this file creates.
#
# HOW OTHER FILES USE THIS:
#   This file is not imported anywhere — it only writes files to disk.
#   retriever.py and query_expansion.py load its output like this:
#
#       from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
#       vector_store = FAISS.load_local(FAISS_INDEX_PATH, embedding_model, ...)

import os
# os lets us list files in a directory and build file paths safely
# across operating systems.

os.environ.setdefault("KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK", "TRUE")
# WORKAROUND: on macOS, faiss and numpy/torch can each bundle their
# own copy of the OpenMP runtime (libomp.dylib). When both get loaded
# in the same process, OpenMP aborts with "Error #15: already
# initialized" instead of silently picking one. This env var tells
# OpenMP to tolerate the duplicate rather than crash. It must be set
# BEFORE faiss is imported below, which is why this line comes first.
# setdefault() means it won't override a value you've already set
# yourself in the shell or .env file.

from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv(override=True)
# Loads environment variables from a local .env file.
# override=True means values in .env always win over any values
# already set in the shell environment.

from langchain_community.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader
# Reads a PDF file page by page and returns one LangChain Document
# object per page, with the page text plus metadata (source path,
# page number) attached automatically.

from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
# Cuts long text into smaller overlapping chunks. "Recursive" means
# it tries the most natural break point first (paragraph), and only
# falls back to a rougher break (single character) if it has to.

from langchain_huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
# Wraps OpenAI's embedding API. Turns a chunk of text into a list of
# numbers (a vector) that captures its meaning.

from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
# FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is the vector database.
# It stores every chunk's vector and lets us search for the closest
# ones to a query vector, extremely fast, even across thousands of
# chunks.

FAISS_INDEX_PATH = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "faiss_index")

# query_expansion.py both read from this exact path, so if you
# change it here, update it in both of those files too.

CHUNK_SIZE = 700
# Target size of each chunk, in characters. Small enough that each
# chunk stays focused on one idea (e.g. one table or one paragraph
# of commentary), large enough to keep useful context together.

CHUNK_OVERLAP = 250
# How many characters consecutive chunks share. Without overlap, a
# sentence that happens to fall right on a chunk boundary gets cut
# in half, and neither resulting chunk makes full sense on its own.
# Overlap protects against that at the cost of some duplicate text
# across the index.

EMBEDDING_MODEL = "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
# Must be the exact same embedding model used later in retriever.py
# and query_expansion.py. Vectors from different embedding models
# live in different, incompatible number-spaces — mixing them would
# silently produce meaningless similarity scores.
